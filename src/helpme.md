# UNO

## Objective of the game
Be the first to run out of cards.

## Game rules
1. Each player will receive 7 starting cards and there will be a starting card on the table, along with a deck for drawing cards.
2. When it is your turn, you must place a card that matches, either in number or color, with the card on the table.
    
    *Example: If the table card is a red 7, you have to place a red card of any number or a 7 of any color. You can also place an action card.*
3. If you don't have any cards that you can place, then they have to grab one from the deck on the table.
4. Whether you've put down a card or picked one from the deck, your turn goes to the next player.
5. When you are left with a single card you must press the "UNO" button, if someone presses it before you, you will have to take two cards from the deck. If an opponent has only one card and does not press "UNO" then you can press it and the opponent will receive two penalty cards.
6. The player who runs out of cards wins.
